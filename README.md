# wordplays
Java program to find Vietnamese wordplays from a given dictionary (currently only for spoonerisms with 2 syllables but it'll be expanded).
The less cluttered the dictionary is, the higher quality the wordplays will be.

Example output from the Viet39K.txt file: [a 100MB .txt file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PubBL9Q8A8oQvGRpmCOAaOZKYUzPsKEO/view?usp=sharing)

The included dictionary files, while not exactly adequte, are much better than other alternatives. Credit goes to [Hồ Ngọc Đức](https://www.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/~duc/software/misc/wordlist.html) for them.
